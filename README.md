# FTMK Proffesional Certificate Management System
UTeM FTMK Professional Certificate Management System 

In FTMK, all the students from cohort 2017/2018 are planned for professional certificate training and exam. All the students in FTMK are required to attend art least one of the certificate training or examination. The lecturer will play very important roles to keep track of the studentsâ€™ certificate status on whether they had completed the payments, completed the training and attend for the examination. There come problems where one lecturer needs to keep track of one batch of students. This process is tedious and tiring because of lecturers unable to view all the reporting through the paper-based system easily. Besides that, there is no proper management system available for the lecturers to check the status of the student and the certification. FTMK Professional Certificate Management System lay its role by making all the process computerized. By going to the computerized process, we can make the tracking process more flexible and faster as the data is stored in the database. This system also able to replace the current attendance system to online attendance system.
